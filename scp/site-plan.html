        This year marks the 25th year of me playing with clay.  I took my first ceramics class during my first semester of college and fell in love with the possibilities clay offers.  I had a truly wonderful teacher, Steve Fredericks, at the Salt Lake Art Center.  The Art Center became my home away from home.  I spent every spare minute there learning and loving being in the company of other potters.  Over the years I also enjoyed taking classes at Circle Pottery, and Petersen Art Center.  Upon purchasing our first home I declared the garage my own and have been able to create a beautiful studio for myself.

      <h3>[Tips, Tricks, Ideas and Inspiration]</h3>
      <p>
        The best part of the clay community is our willingness to share tips, tricks, ideas, and inspiration.  Some say there are no new ideas.  It might be more apt to say there are always new ways to express old ideas.  On this site I will endeavor to always share the best ideas I come across.  Some will be mine, and others will be from some of my favorite online content creators in the ceramic community.  
Having been a potter for 25 years I have had the wonderful opportunity to work in several studios in the Salt Lake area.  The potters I have learned from have taught me so much.  Now that I have a studio in my home, I don’t have the opportunity to spend quality time with other potters as often.  Thank goodness for the internet.  There are so many sources for creative inspiration.
	YouTube: Searching for and finding channels creative by potters who are generous with their knowledge and experience is key.  In time you can have incredibly easy access to unlimited hours of educational videos covering such topics as: simple first-time projects, hand building, wheel throwing, setting up a studio, using pre-made glazes as well as, how to create and mix your own glaze recipes.
	Some Youtube channels worth following:
Hobble Creek Pottery
Vaughan Smith
Jessica Putnam Phillips
Little Street Pottery
Good Elephant Pottery
Ceramic Arts Network
Sunshine Cobb
Michael Harbridge
	Pinterest: With time you can create groups of pins.  If you ever lack inspiration for what project to start, or how to personalize your own work, take the time to create folders pre-loaded with pictures of beautiful work as well as links to allow you to view the source of the content.
	Facebook: There are so many groups you can join with likeminded adventurers.   Some of my favorite Facebook groups are:
		John Britt – Complete Guide to Mid-Range Glazes.  This particular group is for people who have mixed and are using glaze recipes from John Britt’s book.  Mixing your own glazes for the first time, or the fifty-first time can be confusing and possibly frustrating.  This group provides you with the support of your peers.  They can offer suggestions, condolences, and inspiration.  
		Clayshare – A group of over 37,000 members founded by Jessica Putnam Phillips.  She shares glaze information, kiln unloading, and construction videos.
